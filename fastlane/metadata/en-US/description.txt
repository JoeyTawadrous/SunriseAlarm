All alarms will trigger 5-15 minutes earlier than the time they are scheduled for ;)

Ensuring you're never 10 minutes late again!


◆ How It Works

1) Simply create an alarm like you would any other,

2) Be notified by push notification 5 - 15 minutes earlier than the time you selected.


◆ Sunrise Alarm Is Useful When

- Got a meeting? Ensure you're not taking those extra crucial minutes before the meeting for granted.
