All alarms will trigger 5-15 minutes earlier than the time they are scheduled for ;)

Ensuring you're never 10 minutes late again!


# How It Works

1) Simply create an alarm like you would any other,
2) Be notified by push notification 5 - 15 minutes earlier than the time you selected.


# Sunrise Alarm Is Useful When

- Feeling tired? Take a power nap knowing that you will be woken at least a few minutes early.. so you can wake yourself up gently! 
- Got a meeting? Ensure you're not taking those extra crucial minutes before the meeting for granted.
- Ready to watch the latest Game of Thrones? We have you covered. Set an alarm and rest assured that you will be notified well before the show starts!
